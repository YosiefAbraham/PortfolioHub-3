# Profile Image Instructions

To add your profile image to the portfolio:

1. Save your profile photo as `yosief-profile.jpg`
2. Place it in this directory: `client/public/images/`
3. The image will automatically appear in both the Hero and About sections
4. If the image fails to load, it will gracefully fallback to the "YA" initials

The image should be:
- High quality (at least 400x400px)
- Square aspect ratio works best
- JPG format recommended
- File name: `yosief-profile.jpg`

Once you add the image, restart the dev server to see the changes.
